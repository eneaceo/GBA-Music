This is another version of the Game boy music player that I built before.
This time as I couldn't fix the small cuts that ocurred playing the songs I decided to not use Butano Engine.
With this structure the song now play without cuts and is much easier to "port" any album.
I made some generic scripts so anyone can do it. I will update the project with some tutorials so is easier to do it.
As no Engine is used, you just need to have tonc libraries to compile the project. Probably will update it so the libraries are local.
As it is right now, you have to add songs to the AAS_Data folder in .raw format to run it, I dind't want to upload songs that are not mine. 
In this example i'm using Fotocopia's album as an example on how it will look like.
